## Pixel Palace
Pixel palace is a 90s-themed website created for the Hack Club Boba Olympics challenge. This site has three pages and is centered around art that I find interesting on and offline. The three pages can be accessed by clicking the planets, and there are easter eggs hidden throughout the homepage! (Hint: Click the main logo)
